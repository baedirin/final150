  <h3>Who is Circuit Styling?</h3>

  	<div class="about-img"><img src="imgs/hackersbig.jpg"/></div>
    <p>Our company began long, long ago..</p>
    <p>Back in the mythical year of 2004, a group of web developers formed together in Detroit, Michigan. Since then, we've aspired to keep our image clean, minimal, and       sleek. Our design is often retro or "simple", harkening back to the days of early web development in visual style. A few members of our original group have come and       gone, but we've retained our core members and gained a few new ones along the way.
    </p>
    <h3>So, why retro? Who wants old?</h3>
	<p>
    	Excellent question. You'd be surprised who seeks out retro and minimal web design, but the market is there. Often our clientele come from niche areas related to        art, music, and film. Surprisingly, the demand for our design has not only endured the passing years, but increased significantly in the last four to five. Like        fashion, web design will cycle through many visual evolutions, and Circuit Styling intends to be present when retro web design hits its peak.
